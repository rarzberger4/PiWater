# PiWater

PiWater is a project to improve watering your plants in a overcomplicated technical **but** fun way.

The main goal is to use the raspberry-pi platform to control a waterpump, thats watering your thirsty plants. Information on when to water the plants, is gathered from a webserver (node.js) via an API-request.
